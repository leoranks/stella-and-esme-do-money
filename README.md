Been wanting to do a quick little PWA, so figured I'd do it in React, to kill a few birds with the same stone. 

Also wanted to incorporate my two daughters somehow to keep things fun and lighthearted, so used a few pics of them in a feeble attempt at implementing "hero image" design and responsive background strategies.

So in the interest of time, started with good ole CRA, and proceeded to cobble this together from examples found all over the net.  Also features basic minimalist routes courtesy of react-router, real time updates provided by Pusher, and API calls made possible with axios.  Oh yeah... a little bit of composition and props passing merriment, with some node/express sprinkled in as well.
